# Project Salinas

This project is an ongoing work on the treatise of Francisco de
Salinas' music theory treatise _De musica libri septem_, printed 1577
in Salamanca.

To transcribe the original latin print, the
[Transkribus][https://www.transkribus.org/] software is used. The raw
text output is translated to English with [Kagi
Translate][https://translate.kagi.com/]. The English text is then
summarized by Johannes Keller and published on
[Tunings][www.tunings.org] (in preparation). The goal is to represent
the original illustrations with interactive elements. These elements
include sound generators where it is applicable, to explore the sonic
implications of Salinas' thoughts.

This is a longterm project that will hopefully grow slowly over time.
